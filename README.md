## Navigating Human Cytomegalovirus Induced Pathways within the Endocytic Recycling Compartment as a Model for Herpesvirus Egress

### Abstract

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen in developing fetuses, neonates, and individuals with compromised immune systems.  Gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of virion assembly stand in the way of development of antivirals targeting late stages of viral replication.  During infection, HCMV causes a dramatic reorganization of the host endosecretory system, leading to the formation of the cytoplasmic virion assembly complex (cVAC), the site of virion assembly.  As part of cVAC biogenesis, the composition and behavior of endosecretory organelles change. To gain more comprehensive understanding of the impact of HCMV on components of the cellular endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), we used previously published transcriptional and proteomic datasets to predict changes in the directionality of ERC trafficking.  We identified infection-associated changes in gene expression that suggest increased flux of outbound secretory vesicle trafficking; this is consistent with prior observations such as the importance of Rab27A for HCMV maturation and the synaptic vesicle-like lipid composition of HCMV virions.  Our analysis thus enabled development of a model that provides context for numerous previous observations related to the behavior of the ERC during HCMV replication, and suggests experimentally testable hypotheses related to mechanisms involved in HCMV virion maturation and egress.  Information from such experiments will provide a robust foundation for rational development of novel antivirals for HCMV and other viruses.
